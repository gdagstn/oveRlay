# oveRlay
Annotate 2D point clouds using overlay polygons


# Motivation and methodology
This R package (in development) offers an alternative to the concave hull geom in `ggforce` by taking an entirely different approach:
- creaties a regularly spaced grid of squares, whose side is defined by a step size (a fraction of the range of your data)
- calculates which squares contain points, with user-defined tolerance, and keeps the vertices
- uses `isoband` to calculate a contour joining vertices on the grid
- calculates holes, i.e. which polygons are inside other polygons, so that their space can be "subtracted" when plotting by `ggplot2` 
- optional smoothing (via `smoothr`), offset (via `polyclip`) and joining of overlapping polygons (again via `polyclip`)

The resulting polygon (or sets of polygons) follow the shapes of the point cloud quite closely and, if a point or set of points is far enough, another disjointed polygon is created. This allows to deal with outliers nicely; the current `ggforce` implementation of `geom_mark_hull()` is super fast, but will enclose *all* points no matter how far they are. 

The step size controls how granular the resulting polygon set is: small step sizes will create shapes that follow the data more closely (at the expense of computing speed and, eventually, usability). 

Here is an example of how different step sizes behave on the same set of 2D `rnorm(1000)`:

# Installation

You can install `oveRlay` through `devtools`:

```{r}
library(devtools)
install_github("gdagstn/oveRlay")
```

# Examples

Using oveRlay is simple:

```{r}
library(oveRlay)

dat <- matrix(rnorm(1000), ncol = 2)

# Normal usage
overlay <- makeOverlay(dat, min_pts = 1, stepsize = 0.06, minsize = 4)
plot(dat, pch = 16, cex = 0.5, xlim = range(overlay[,1:2]), ylim = range(overlay[,1:2]))
for(i in unique(overlay$cluster)) polygon(overlay[overlay$cluster == i, 1:2])
```

```
# Decreasing step size (increasing granularity)
overlay <- makeOverlay(dat, min_pts = 1, stepsize = 0.02, minsize = 4)
plot(dat, pch = 16, cex = 0.5, xlim = range(overlay[,1:2]), ylim = range(overlay[,1:2]))
for(i in unique(overlay$cluster)) polygon(overlay[overlay$cluster == i, 1:2])
```

# Increasing offset
overlay <- makeOverlay(dat,min_pts = 1, stepsize = 0.02, minsize = 4, offset_prop = 0.08)
plot(dat, pch = 16, cex = 0.5, xlim = range(overlay[,1:2]), ylim = range(overlay[,1:2]))
for(i in unique(overlay$cluster)) polygon(overlay[overlay$cluster == i, 1:2])
```

```
# Increasing offset without joining polygons
overlay <- makeOverlay(dat,min_pts = 1, stepsize = 0.02, minsize = 4, offset_prop = 0.08, join_polys = FALSE)
plot(dat, pch = 16, cex = 0.5, xlim = range(overlay[,1:2]), ylim = range(overlay[,1:2]))
for(i in unique(overlay$cluster)) polygon(overlay[overlay$cluster == i, 1:2])
```
